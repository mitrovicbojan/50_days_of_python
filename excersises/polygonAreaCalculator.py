Build a Polygon Area Calculator
In this project, you will use object-oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. 
The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit its methods and attributes.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should create a Rectangle class.

When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with width and height attributes. 
The class should also contain the following methods:

set_width: Sets the width of the rectangle.
set_height: Sets the height of the rectangle.
get_area: Returns area ( width×height
 ).
get_perimeter: Returns perimeter  2(width+height)
 .
get_diagonal: Returns diagonal  width2+height2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
 .
get_picture: Returns a string that represents the shape using lines of *. 
The number of lines should be equal to the height and the number of * in each line should be equal to the width.
There should be a new line (\n) at the end of each line. 
If the width or height is larger than 50, this should return the string: Too big for picture..
get_amount_inside: Takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument. 
Returns the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations). 
For instance, a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 8 could fit in two squares with sides of 4.
If an instance of a Rectangle is represented as a string, it should look like: Rectangle(width=5, height=10).

You should create a Square class that subclasses Rectangle.

When a Square object is created, it should be initialized with a single side length. 
The __init__ method should store the side length in both the width and height attributes from the Rectangle class.

The Square class should contain the following methods:

set_width: Overrides the set_width method from the Rectangle class. 
It should set the width and height to the side length.
set_height: Overrides the set_height method from the Rectangle class. 
It should set the width and height to the side length.
set_side: Sets the height and width of the square equal to the side length.
The Square class should be able to access the Rectangle class methods.

If an instance of a Square is represented as a string, it should look like: Square(side=9).
