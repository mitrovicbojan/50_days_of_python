'''
You should define an abstract class named Player 
that inherits from the abc.ABC class.

The Player class should have an __init__ method that sets:

The moves attribute to an empty list.
The position attribute to (0, 0).
The path attribute to a list containing the initial position.
The Player class should have a method named make_move that:

Uses random.choice to get a random move from the moves 
attribute (defined in the concrete class).
Adds the values from the selected move to the current 
position and updates the position attribute.
Appends the new position tuple to the path attribute.
Returns the new position.
The Player class should have an abstract method named level_up 
to be implemented in concrete classes.

You should define a Pawn class that inherits from the Player class.

The Pawn class should use super() to call the parent's __init__ method 
and then set the moves attribute to a list of tuples representing x, y coordinates.

Each coordinate tuple should represent a movement of 1 unit 
in the following directions: up, down, left, right.

The Pawn class should implement a concrete level_up method by 
adding more moves to the moves attribute. The added moves should 
represent the four diagonal movements (for example, 1 unit down plus 1 unit left).

Note: Standard library modules should be imported without 
using aliases. Tests related to the Player class will fail until 
the Pawn class becomes instantiable.
