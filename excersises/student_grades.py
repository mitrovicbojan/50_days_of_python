Student Grades

Create a Student class:

Attributes: name and grades (list of floats, default empty list).

Methods:

add_grade(grade) → adds grade to list.

average() → returns the average grade (rounded to 2 decimals).

__str__() → "Student <name>, Average: <average>".

Bonus: Make a class method class_average(students_list) that calculates the average grade for a list of Student objects.
